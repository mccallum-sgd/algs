What are reasonable values of "small" and "large" values of N?
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a pretty ambiguous question but I'll take a stab at it.
A reasonable small value of N would be 10,000 I would say, still
extremely fast and pretty practical for most data-sets. If you're
working with very large databases then 100,000 would probably be 
the limit. 50ms is  about what you want to have to take with an 
algorithm in real-world applications and making clients wait any 
more than that is not ideal.

Do these agree with the expected rate of runtime growth?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I would say it's linear. I plotted the 
runtimes and N's on my calculator and the graph is
basically linear.
