Collaboration
Riley Beckham: 
- He hasn't had much time to work on it and he's really scrambling so I wanted to help him as 
much as I could
- I clarified that we could use the libs provided
- I pointed out some specifics in the directions
- I asked some basic questions to get him thinking

Connor C (can't remember last name): 
- He was already almost finished when I talked to him
- I was confused whether what I was doing was going to work so I reached out to him for clarification
	- I said I used a boolean array, he confirmed he did as well
	- I said I was confused about how to associate the sites from QuickFind with my Percolation sites when
	I don't have access to the indexes, he clarified that I actually do (I misinterpreted the documentation)
- Discussed whether sites with touching corner should be connected and we agreed that it wouldn't make sense.
