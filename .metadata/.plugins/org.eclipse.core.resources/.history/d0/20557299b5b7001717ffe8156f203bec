What are reasonable values of "small" and "large" values of N?
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a pretty ambiguous question but I'll take a stab at it.
A reasonable small value of N would be 10,000 I would say, still
extremely fast and pretty practical for most data-sets. If you're
working with very large databases then 100,000 would probably be 
the limit. 50ms is  about what you want to have to take with an 
algorithm in real-world applications and making clients wait any 
more than that is not ideal.

Time Spent
N			Construct	Removal
100			17.68%		82.32%
1,000		16.46%		83.54%
10,000		21.03%		78.97%
100,000		22.79%		77.21%
1,000,000	11.99%		88.01%
AVERAGE		17.99%		82.01%
--------------------------------------------------------
Do these agree with the expected rate of runtime growth?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I would say both construction and removal are linear.
Each time I multiplied N by ten, I get a proportional 
increase in the runtime. In fact, it almost looks like 
the runtime is on average pretty close to 5N.

AVERAGE		13.58%			86.34%

--------------------------------------------------------
Do these agree with the expected rate of runtime growth?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I would say they're both linear. Pretty much the same
case as with the MinPQ implementation (see above).
