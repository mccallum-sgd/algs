Collaboration
Riley Beckham: he hasn't had much time to work on it and he's really scrambling so I wanted to help him as 
much as I could. In short, I clarified that we could use the libs provided, and basically paraphrased some 
of the directions into what I think is the most important parts.

Connor C (can't remember last name): 
- He was already almost finished when I talked to him
- I was confused whether what I was doing was going to work so I reached out to him for clarification
	- I said I used a boolean array, he confirmed he did as well
	- I said I was confused about how to associate the sites from QuickFind with my Percolation sites when
	I don't have access to the indexes, he clarified that I actually do (I misinterpretated the documentation)
- Discussed whether sites with touching corner should be connected and we agreed that it wouldn't make sense.
